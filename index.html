            <h1>Something About A Cat</h1>
            <small>Ismail O. Daud</small>
            <p>
                The cat which is also known as Felis Catus belongs to a 
                carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated cat in its family known as Felidae. 
                People refer to cats as domestic cats to differentiate them from the wild members of the family.
                A cat can be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat which will be ranging freely to avoid human contact. This beautiful cute and emphatic domestic pet is widely loved for its human companionship.

Cat is endowed with a sturdy flexible body, retractable claws – adapted to killing small prey, quick response to a stimulus, and sharp teeth for cracking bones of the prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are greatly developed to the extent that it can smell an aroma of frying fish from a distance of about 1.5 to 4 miles away.

Cats communicate with vocalizations like hissing, meowing, purring, tilling, growling and grunting – the specific cat body language.

According to research from cat registries, there are about Sixty cat breeds all over the world. I will explain two cat breeds in this write-up.

            <p>There was a cat of mine kidnapped about three years ago. The cat was large and beautiful. You would nearly take him for a tiger cub. I bathed him, creamed and brushed his pawns. He had his medications and body lotions including sweet perf to be sprayed when we had done. Some people challenged me why I should be taking care of a cat like that. They would mock and make jest until 
                that guy got kidnapped by an indigent person. If you take good care of your cats, 
                society will stop seeing them as evil spirits.
